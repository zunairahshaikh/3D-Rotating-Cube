# 🧊 Behold, The Spinning Cube! 🧊

Ever wanted to feel like you're in a retro 3D graphics demo? No? Well, too bad, because now you have **the ultimate 3D spinning cube project** that does absolutely... nothing, but spin! Welcome to the repo, where I merge the power of Python, NumPy, and Pygame to create a mesmerizing rotating cube.

## 📜 What is This?
This is a Python project that renders a 3D cube that spins as per user input. Why? Because spinning cubes are cool, and sometimes life just needs a bit of geometry in motion. 

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 
- **NumPy**
- **Pygame**

## ⚙️ How It Works
  - The vertices of a cube are defined in 3D space.
  - A rotation matrix does the heavy lifting, spinning the cube on all three axes.
  - Pygame projects the 3D points into 2D and draws the edges.
  - The cube spins, the world keeps turning, and your day becomes exponentially better.

## 🎮 How to Run The Code
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install numpy pygame
   ```
3. Run the code in a code editor that supports python, or run the script:
   ```
   python code.py
   ```
4. Press x, y or z to spin the cube in the respective direction
5. Enjoy! 😺
